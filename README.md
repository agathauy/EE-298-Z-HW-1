# EE 298-Z HW 1
Submission for the first programming assignment for EE 298-Z

# Results
It can be observed that for an implementation of 3 layers for both MLP and CNN, the CNN implementation outperforms the MLP implementation.

## Best Performance for MLP Implementation
`Epoch 97/100, 28.44 s loss: 1.2111  -  acc: 0.6504  -  val_loss: 1.3665  -  val_acc: 0.5975`

## Best Performance for CNN Implementation
`Epoch 124/125- 20s 25ms/step - loss: 0.5214 - acc: 0.8578 - val_loss: 0.4932 - val_acc: 0.8720`
